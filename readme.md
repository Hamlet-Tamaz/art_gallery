Brief Summary:

Hi! Welcome to my gallery of Artists and Art where you can:

View, create, update and delete Artists and their Art. 
It is recommended to start by visiting the Artists' page and picking an artist who's work to view.
You can also view the Art alone by visiting the Art page.
This library was built using Total.js, Bootstrap, jQuery, Font Awesome, PostreSQL.
Please, note features such as the responsive design, flash messages, autofocusing, dynamic page updates, as well as everything else that went in to making a perfect little gallery.
